        <div class="child"><p>My name is Jonah Phillipson-Masters. I am a second year student at the University of Dundee. I have taken a great interest into software programming and believe I have a good handle on being able to solve
        difficult problems and have the ability to come together with a team to produce a desired outcome. I have become skilled in many fields of programming, having utilised Java, C, Python and SQL to name a few. I have also become proficient in merging HTML and CSS
        to have a broad range of computing abilities.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Over the course of both school and university education thus far I have proven myself as a team player, managing to work with dedication
        to meet deadlines and help my peers along the way. In high school I was often the first to give out advice regarding coding and became very fond of the subject as I noted it as something I both
        and exceled in. I also like to use my other skills while programming to create unique ideas and let my other talents flourish during projects, for example creating a musical doorbell using a raspberry Pi
        and a buzzer, recreating songs using frequencies, showing my passion for music and the performing arts.</p>
