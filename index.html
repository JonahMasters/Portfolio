        <div class="child"><p>My name is Jonah Phillipson-Masters. I am a second year student at the University of Dundee. I have taken a great interest into software programming and believe I have a good handle on being able to solve
        difficult problems and have the ability to come together with a team to produce a desired outcome. I have become skilled in many fields of programming, having utilised Java, C, Python and SQL to name a few. I have also become proficient in merging HTML and CSS
        to have a broad range of computing abilities.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Over the course of both school and university education thus far I have proven myself as a team player, managing to work with dedication
        to meet deadlines and help my peers along the way. In high school I was often the first to give out advice regarding coding and became very fond of the subject as I noted it as something I both
        and exceled in. I also like to use my other skills while programming to create unique ideas and let my other talents flourish during projects, for example creating a musical doorbell using a raspberry Pi
        and a buzzer, recreating songs using frequencies, showing my passion for music and the performing arts.</p>

        <p>In First year at university I was part of a team building a messaging system, which allowed users to open and read messages from colleagues and friends, search by names to display all messages from one person and also to delete messages and 
            open up separate tabs to display all message logs from each contact.

            <h2>Embedded Systems</h2>
            <p>I was part of a project group in Second semester of First year tasked with creating our own design for using a Raspberry Pi device paired with a web page and micropython scripting to carry out a task. My team and I decided on using a sensor
                and a buzzer to create an automated doorbell system, which I helped curate songs using frequencies through the buzzer and worked on connection issues between the device and the scripting.
