    <h2>My experience</h2>
    <br>
    <p style="text-align: right; margin-right: 20px;">My name is Jonah Phillipson-Masters. I am a second year student at the University of Dundee. I have taken a great interest into software programming and believe I have a good handle on being able to solve
    difficult problems and have the ability to come together with a team to produce a desired outcome. I have become skilled in many fields of programming, having utilised Java, C, Python and SQL to name a few. I have also become proficient in merging HTML and CSS
    to have a broad range of computing abilities.</p>
    <br>
    <p style="text-align: right; margin-right: 20px;">Over the course of both school and university education thus far I have proven myself as a team player, managing to work with dedication
    to meet deadlines and help my peers along the way. In high school I was often the first to give out advice regarding coding and became very fond of the subject as I noted it as something i both
    and exceled in. I also like to use my other skills while programming to create unique ideas and let my other talents flourish during projects, for example creating a musical doorbell using a raspberry Pi
    and a buzzer, recreating songs using frequencies, showing my passion for music and the performing arts.</p>
